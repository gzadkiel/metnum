# MetodosNumericos
Various numerical methods programmed in Octave. 

Everything will soon be compiled into a couple of general scripts to organize things a bit better, that is, whenever I have the time to do it. 

Inside the **functions** folder you will find other folders called "f_...". They contain mostly functions, in case you find yourself more attracted to those, as opposed to the general scripts found on the main page. 

Packages required to run some of the scripts:  
- [Symbolic Package](https://github.com/cbm755/octsympy) 
- [Splines Package](https://octave.sourceforge.io/splines/index.html)

To do: 
- [X] Upload everything. 
- [ ] Review and update all the scripts. 
- [ ] ...

If you find any problems, please submit an issue.
